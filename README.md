**# CarSalesDataAnalysis**

This project is a simple implementation for  data analysis and visualization on a dataset containing information about car sales. 
The dataset included details such as **brand, model, year, sales quantity,** and **price** for various car models.

**Accomplishments**
 1. Explored the dataset using **Python** and **NumPy**. Calculated summary statistics such as total sales quantity and average price.
 2. Conducted **basic data analysis** tasks using **NumPy** and the **Counter class** from the **collections module**. This included identifying the most common brand and its corresponding sales quantity. 
 3. Visualized the sales data using **Matplotlib,** generating a bar chart that shows sales by brand. This visualization provides a clear representation of the distribution of sales among different car brands.

**Skills**
- Python Programming
- Data Analysis
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Basic statistics and data manipulation techniques
